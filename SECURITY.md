# Security Policy

I pride Ermis in its security. For Ermis, security isn't just a feature — it's a cornerstone, and I stake its very reputation on it.

In a world where our privacy is perpetually undermined, and our personal data has become the currency of the tech world, — from tech giants exploiting our data for targeted advertisment, to utilizing it to train their LLMs —, people deserve something in which they can bestow their trust. A communication platform that is not plagued by constant advertising and without any privacy concerns.

Hence **_Ermis_**: a secure and open-source messaging platform for real-time communication — and since security is one of its primary selling points, I am determined to ensure that it stays up-to-date with the latest best practices and recommendations in the field of cybersecurity.

In essence, this document briefly outlines how to report vulnerabilities responsibly.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this project, **please do not file a public issue or pull request**. Instead, email my directly at [ilias.koukovinis@gmail.com].

When you contact me, please include:

- **A detailed description** of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Affected versions** of the project
- **Any suggested mitigations** or workarounds, if known

## Additional Security Practices

If you plan  to contribute to the project please consider the points made here:

- Please ensure any external dependency added is not afflicted by any severe security vulnerability.
- Please, do not store any sensitive credentials or secrets within the source code.  
  For obvious reasons, this is a recipe for disaster.
