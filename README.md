Ermis is an open-source project and suite of applications designed for secure and seamless communication. The project consists of the following components:

- **Mercury-Client (Desktop)**: The user-facing desktop client application developed with JavaFX.
- **Ermis Μ (Mobile)**: The mobile client-side application powered by Flutter.
- **Ermis-Server**: The backend server that handles everything related to server-side.
- **Ermis-Common**: The shared library containing common functionalities and utilities used by both the client and server.

## Vision

My vision while creating Ermis was to develop a server-side application that anyone can deploy with ease and efficiency to ensure it can run on even the oldest hardware. Alongside this, I aimed to build a client-side application - that boasts an intuitive and user-friendly interface - with a solid performance to complement the server. With a primary focus on security, the Ermis platform employs robust encryption methods to ensure the protection of user data and privacy. Ultimately, I aimed to create a platform where users can communicate freely and openly, knowing their information is safe from prying eyes. My ultimate aim is to create a platform that anyone can host with ease and communicate with.

## Features

- **Real-time Communication**: Communicate seamlessly with others in real-time.
- **Media Sharing**: Easily share media within your chats.
- **Secure Connections**: Integrated with TLS encryption to ensure privacy and security.
- **PostgreSQL Integration**: Manage user data, messages, and logs in a reliable relational database geared towards data integrity.

## Future Enhancements

Moving forward, I do not have any particular plans regarding Ermis's development in mind right now. As a general idea I would like to:

- **Enhance Scalability**: Further optimize the server-side application to handle even larger loads.
- **Improve Code Readability**: Refactor the codebase to improve maintainability and readability.
- **Expand Features**: Introduce new functionalities in order to enrich user experience.

## Wiki/Documentation

You can find thorough documentation and a more in-depth analysis of Ermis here: [Wiki](https://github.com/Koukobin/Ermis/wiki/)

## Getting Started

To set up the project locally, follow the instructions for each component:

1. [Mercury-Client (Dekstop)](./ErmisClient/Desktop/README.md)
2. [Ermis Μ (Mobile)](./ErmisClient/Mobile/ermis_client/README.md)
3. [Ermis-Server](./ErmisServer/README.md)
4. [Ermis-Common](./ErmisCommon/README.md)

## Potential Questions

* Q: Is there a mobile version of Ermis?
	- A: Yes! The Ermis Client is designed not only for desktop platforms (Linux, Windows) but also for mobile devices running Android.
* Q: Is there an IOS version of Ermis?
    - A: Although the mobile client is developed using Flutter - a cross-platform UI framework -, Apple's stringent/rigorous requirements make building an iOS version (IPA) a pain in the ass. Requiring Apple hardware, compiling in Xcode and I don't even know what else. One thing is for certain - I am not spending money tantamount to buying a car to solely build an iOS version. Consequently, the release of an iOS version is *non potest fieri*.
* Q: Is there a macOS version of Mercury-Client?
	- A: At the moment, Mercury-Client is designed for Windows and Linux - even though it is programmed in Java. Due to Apple's protectionist and closed-platform policies, a dedicated macOS version is not available at this time, but future updates may include support for the macOS platform as well. **With that being said though**, because **MacOS is a Unix-based system**, the **.zip package of the app very likely works**.
* Q: Are installers for Mercury-Client available for all Linux distributions?
	- A: Unfortunately, at the present moment, Mercury-Client is available exclusively for Debian-based distributions (such as Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Kali Linux). In the future, I hope to include support for Red Hat-based distributions (like Fedora and CentOS) and other distros, such as Arch Linux. **Having said that though**, the **.zip package of the app very likely works for all Unix-based distributions** universally.
* Q: Is my data secure while using Ermis?
    - A: Yes, Ermis employs robust encryption methods to ensure the protection of user data and privacy.
    
## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! To contribute:

1. **Fork the repository.**
2. **Open a new issue** — if you are intending to fix a bug or feature — describing it thoroughly.
3. **Create a new branch** for your feature or bug fix.
4. **Ensure your code is clean and readable** — at least to some extent.  
   It doesn't have to be perfect, but aim for clarity, and avoid ambiguity and complexity as much as possible.  
   
   Remember:
