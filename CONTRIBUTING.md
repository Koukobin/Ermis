Thank you so much for wanting to contribute to Ermis! Your help is essential for keeping it great! 

Please note that this project adheres to a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).  
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [ilias.koukovinis@gmail.com].

[code-of-conduct]: CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

In order to contribute:

1. **Fork the repository.**
2. **Open a new issue** — if you are intending to fix a bug or feature — describing it thoroughly.
3. **Create a new branch** for your feature or bug fix.
4. **Ensure your code is clean and readable** — at least to some extent.  
   It doesn't have to be perfect, but aim for clarity, and avoid ambiguity and complexity as much as possible.  
   
   Remember:
   >  _"An idiot admires complexity, while a genius appreciates simplicity"_  
   >  — **Terry A. Davis**  
   > 
   > _"Truth is ever to be found in simplicity, and not in the multiplicity and confusion of things"_  
   > — **Sir Isaac Newton**  
   
   Lastly, try adhering to the most rudimental and basic [programming principles].

> **Note:** if you are wondering what this project's style guide is — it doesn't have one. Nevertheless, if you are looking for a reference of how files should be formatted:
> 
> - For code formatting, I have found that [Google's Style guide] is thorough, comprehensive — and broadly applicable.
> - In terms of documentation, I would suggest [Microsoft's Writing Style Guide].
> 
> That said, don't sweat too much about following these strictly — I myself probably don't conform to most of their conventions.

5. **Submit a pull request** with a detailed description of your changes — and I may review it eventually.

## Pull requests

Unless the change is something very trivial, such as correcting a typo, it's 
generally best to begin by opening a new issue outlining the bug or feature you 
intend to address. Even if you think it's relatively insignificant, it's helpful 
to know what people are working on.

Some examples of types of pull requests that are immediately helpful:

  - Fixing a typo.
  - Improving documentation.
  - Removing redundant configurations.

Guidelines for any code contributions:

  1. All contributions must be licensed under AGPL 3.0 (As dictated by the license) and all files must have a
     copy of the boilerplate license comment; i.e `LICENSE.txt`.
  2. Please squash all commits for a change into a single commit (this can be done using `git rebase -i`).  
     Do your best to have a [well-formed commit message] for the change.
