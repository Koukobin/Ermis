# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: 09-07-2025_

User privacy is a bedrock of this project — and I am commited to ensuring that it remains that way.  
This project does **not** collect, store, or share any user data — by default.

## Forks or Third-Party Services

If you are using a hosted version, a fork, or an Ermis-Server instance that integrates any third-party services or code/plugins not native to the Ermis repository, please review their respective privacy policies separately.
## Compliance

While Ermis itself does not process or collect any personal data — if you deploy or modify Ermis in a way that involves user data collection, you are responsible for complying with the pertinent data protection laws (such as the [GDPR]).
